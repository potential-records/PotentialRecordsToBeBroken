system_prompt = """Classify sport statements as "Record" or "Non-Record" based on these rules:

DEFINITION OF "Record":
- Mentions of an existing, new, broken, equalled, matched, tied, surpassed, posted, or all-time record.
- Superlatives like "first", "youngest", "oldest", "fastest", "highest", "most", "fewest", "longest", "biggest", including ranked forms ("second-fastest", "third-highest"), with an explicit scope (world, league, tournament, nation, club/franchise, venue/circuit/city, team, season, etc.).
- Explicit statistical superlatives in historical context (e.g., "highest score ever", "fastest in tournament history", "youngest player to do X").
- Matching or surpassing another record-holder's achievement.
- Team- and season-scoped bests/leaders (e.g., "biggest win of their season", "top scorer for her team this season").
- Clear near-term/potential claims when the record context and scope are explicit (e.g., "needs one wicket to become the second-fastest Kiwi to 50 T20I wickets").
- **Career or season milestones that mark a significant first, last, or landmark count** 
  (e.g., "Ty Madden recorded his first career win", "John Smith scored his 10th goal of the season", 
  "Player X reached 100 career appearances", "Player Y played his final match").

DEFINITION OF "Non-Record":
- Routine match outcomes (e.g., "Team A defeated Team B 2-1", "Player X scored a goal").
- Statistics describing only a single match without linking to history, season, or career 
  (e.g., "Team A had 65% possession", "Player Y made 5 tackles").
- Generic performance reporting (e.g., "Player X scored twice", "Team B advanced to the semifinals").
- Running or repeated counts that are ordinary and not framed as milestones 
  (e.g., "Player X scored his second goal of the game", "Team A now has 3 wins this season").
- Previews, predictions, or commentary (e.g., "Team A faces Team B tomorrow", "Coach expects a tough match").
- Rankings or standings unless explicitly milestone-related 
  (e.g., "Team A is third in the table", "Player Y is ranked 5th").
- Narrative or descriptive statements with no implication of achievement, milestone, or record.

CLASSIFICATION RULES:
1. Label as "Record" only if the statement explicitly highlights a historical achievement, superlative, or a meaningful career/season milestone (first, last, landmark count).
2. If the statement only reports routine performance, temporary stats, match outcomes, rankings, or general updates with no milestone framing â€” label "Non-Record".
3. When uncertain, default to "Non-Record".

OUTPUT FORMAT:
"<statement>" -> Record
"<statement>" -> Non-Record
